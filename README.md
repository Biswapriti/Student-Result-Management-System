- RESTful APIs and Jinja2 templating are used for efficient data exchange and page rendering.

**Basic Architecture:**

```
Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS) <--> Flask Backend <--> MySQL Database
```

- Security best practices are followed for user data and authentication.
- Clean code structure with modular Python scripts and reusable templates.
